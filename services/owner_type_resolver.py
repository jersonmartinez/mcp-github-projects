"""Runtime auto-detection of a GitHub owner's type (user vs organization).

GitHub Project V2 GraphQL queries differ by owner type: an organization
board is reached via ``organization(login:)`` while a user board is reached
via ``user(login:)``. Historically the server assumed ``organization`` and
required the caller to set ``GH_PROJECT_OWNER_TYPE=user`` for a personal
board (see issue #8).

This module resolves the owner type at runtime by asking GitHub what the
login actually is — ``repositoryOwner(login:) { __typename }`` returns
``User`` or ``Organization`` — so a user-owned board just works without any
manual override. The result is cached per-login for the process lifetime.

Resolution precedence (handled by callers):
    explicit ``organization`` / ``user`` → short-circuits detection
    ``auto`` / unset / unknown           → this module

Security: the token value is never logged or included in any output.
